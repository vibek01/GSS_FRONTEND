                2. `hover:scale-125`: The hover effect is adjusted to zoom in even further for a nice interactive feel.

          Founded in 2018, Gyana Shree Social Society emerged from a small group of dedicated
          community members who recognized the critical need for accessible education and skill
          development in underserved areas. What started as informal weekend training sessions has
          grown into a comprehensive community development initiative.

          Today, we serve hundreds of families across multiple districts, offering programs in
          vocational training, digital literacy, health awareness, women's empowerment, and
          sustainable agriculture. Our success is measured not in numbers, but in the transformed
          lives and strengthened communities we serve.
